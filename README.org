Rust implementation of the lox language from [[https://craftinginterpreters.com/][Crafting Interpreters]]. ~jlox~
contains almost the first 10 chapters of the tree-walking interpreter from Part
II. It remains unfinished because my ~Environment~ implementation doesn't return
mutable references to the ~Values~ it contains, which means calling closures
doesn't update their environments. This means running ~testfiles/counter.lox~
produces

#+begin_src text
  1
  1
#+end_src

instead of

#+begin_src text
  1
  2
#+end_src

because each call to ~counter~ gets its own, cloned instance of ~counter~ from the
environment instead of getting the same reference to the same ~counter~.

~clox~ will eventually contain the bytecode interpreter from Part III, hopefully
with a full implementation.
