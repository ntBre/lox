Rust implementation of the lox language from [[https://craftinginterpreters.com/][Crafting Interpreters]]. ~jlox~
contains (most of) the tree-walking interpreter from Part II. ~clox~ contains the
bytecode interpreter from Part III.

~jlox~ is a bit stalled out because of issues with my ~Environment~ implementation,
but I may come back to it after working on ~clox~, if all goes well.
